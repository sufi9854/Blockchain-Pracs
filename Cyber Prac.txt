Prac 1A)  Recovering Data Using EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard

1. Preparation Phase 
1.1 
Download EaseUS :- Visit https://www.easeus.com and download the EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Free/Trial version. 
1.2  
Install the Software:- Follow installation steps. Do not install on the same drive from where you want to recover data. 
1.3 
Create a Test 
Scenario (Optional) :- Format a USB drive or delete some files manually to simulate accidental data loss.
2.1 
Launch EaseUS :- Open the application as Administrator. 
2.2 
Select the Location to Scan :- Choose the drive or partition from which the data was deleted/lost (e.g., USB Drive D:). 
2.3 
Quick Scan Starts Automatically :- EaseUS first performs a quick scan to find recently deleted 
files. 
2.4 
Deep Scan (Automatic) :-Automatically begins if quick scan does not find all files. This will take more time but is more thorough. 
2.5 
Preview Files :- After scanning, EaseUS shows files in folders like Deleted Files, Lost Files, RAW, etc. You can preview documents, images, videos.

Prac 1B)  Performing Hash, Checksum, or HMAC Calculationsusing the HashCalc.

1. Preparation Phase 
1.1 Download 
HashCalc 
Download from a trusted source like 
https://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/. 
1.2 Install the Software 
Follow the on-screen installation instructions. It’s a lightweight tool. 
1.3 Prepare Files for Hashing 
Choose a sample file (e.g., document.txt, image.jpg, etc.) for which you’ll compute the hash.

2.  Performing Hash Calculation 
2.1 Launch HashCalc 
Open the application from the Start Menu. 
2.2 Select Data Type 
Choose File (you can also select Text, Hex String, etc.).

2.5 Click Calculate 
Press the Calculate button. The hashes will be generated in a 
few seconds. 

3. Validation & Reporting 
4.1 File Integrity Check 
Later, re-run HashCalc on the same file. If the hash matches, file integrity is confirmed. 
4.2 Tampering Simulation (Optional) 
Modify the file and recalculate the hash — the new 
hash will differ, proving tampering.
